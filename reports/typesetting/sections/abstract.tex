\begin{abstract}\label{sec:abstract}
The abstract gives away the results and lets the audience decide if they wish to read the document to understand how the author has reached those results. This means the abstract needs to be informative and descriptive.

Roughly the structure should be:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 25\% setting the context and problem (2-3 sentences).
    \item Method (25\%)
    \item The principle finding, its novelty and implications (~50\%, approximately 5-6 sentences).
\end{itemize}
\end{abstract}
