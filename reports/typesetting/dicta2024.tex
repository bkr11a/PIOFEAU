\section*{Acknowledgment}

The preferred spelling of the word ``acknowledgment'' in America is without 
an ``e'' after the ``g''. Avoid the stilted expression ``one of us (R. B. 
G.) thanks $\ldots$''. Instead, try ``R. B. G. thanks$\ldots$''. Put sponsor 
acknowledgments in the unnumbered footnote on the first page.

%If you have an EPS/PDF photo (graphicx package needed), extra braces are
% needed around the contents of the optional argument to biography to prevent
% the LaTeX parser from getting confused when it sees the complicated
% $\backslash${\tt{includegraphics}} command within an optional argument. (You can create
% your own custom macro containing the $\backslash${\tt{includegraphics}} command to make things
% simpler here.)

\begin{IEEEbiography}[{\includegraphics[width=1in,height=1.25in,clip,keepaspectratio]{authorImages/IMG_2976.JPG}}]{Brad Rice}
	is a doctoral candidate in the School of Computing and Information Technology at the University of Wollongong, Australia. His work focuses on '\textit{Physics Inspired Deep Neural Networks for Computer Vision}'. Physics-informed learning has a broad applicability across various domains and allow for an amalgamation between first principles and machine learning methods. Brad is currently a student researcher in the Advanced Multimedia Research Lab, University of Wollongong and works in the energy and resources industry as a senior data scientist. Brad holds a Master of Computer Science (2021) and Bachelor of Mathematics (2019) from the University of Wollongong, where his research interests include computer vision, applied mathematical modelling, optimisation methodologies and machine learning.
